# Pacmen
## Factory for making Pacmen

How to Run:  
    - Click on "Add Pacman" to make a Pacman appear on the screen, create as many Pacmen as you would like.
    - Click on "Start Game" to make the Pacmen start moving around the screen.

Future plans:
    - To make the background black
    - When the pacmen hit a wall their faces should flip 180Â° on the horizontal so I will need to adjust some of the images.
